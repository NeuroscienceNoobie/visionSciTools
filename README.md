# SHINE_Pre_Processing_Tool
It was created to meet the requirements for using the legendary OG SHINE toolbox(http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/gosselif/SHINE/), in which required the images to be ***grayscale images of the same size***. The present tool was tailered to meet both of the afromentioned requirements, along with the ability to scale(resize) and modify file type.  
   
   ## How to use the SHINE_Pre_Processing_Tool:
   0. run the script in any IDE you want
   1. tick the options that you need
      - Convert to Grayscale: Tick this if you want to convert images into grayscale. (which is required for the OG SHINE toolbox)

   2. Desired File Type: Specify what file type(s) should the tool look for.
   3. Resolution: Choose whatever option you want, just note that by choosing the non aspect ratio retaining options (e.g., 128*128), the images may be stratched/ forced into the  specified resulution. If you wish to retain the original, pick the "Retain Aspect Ratio" options.
   4. The last one is just a simple reminder! 
   5. press "Proceed!!"
   6. You will be promped to provide the directory of the ***source folders***. Navigate to the folder containing the image(s) to be processed.
